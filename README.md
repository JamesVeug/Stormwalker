*An Against the Storm Tweakpack*

A variety pack of convenience features popularly requested for [Against the Storm](https://www.gog.com/game/against_the_storm). No real theme or direction, just things I found useful and easy to mod mashed together to hopefully be useful to others.

**This mod is currently InDev**. The code is a mess, there might be bugs, and the keybinds haven't been integrated into the options menu and as a result they aren't configurable. It is functional, but I'm hoping to go back and clean the mod up soon.

## Features

- Mines have a working area. No more missing out on a single ore spawn because a 3x3 area can't cover every deposit.
- Overview zoom Mode. Press **Backspace** in game to immediately gain a better perspective on your map. Press **Backspace** again to zoom back in.
- Building production limits can now be increased by **5/10** by using **Ctrl-Click**/**Shift-click** respectively.
- Hovering over a resource deposit and pressing **Shift** will request the construction of the associated gathering camp, similar to how **Shift** while hovering over buildings copies them.
- Trade post can now be moved. Just hover over it and press **M** to start moving it.
-  **5x** speed mode. Available as additional UI button and the **5** keybind. Gotta go fast!
- Easily place Paths by pressing **P**

## Installation

1. Download BepInEx 5: https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases/download/v5.4.21/BepInEx_x86_5.4.21.0.zip
2. Extract into your Against the Storm game directory
3. Grab the latest release of this mod from https://github.com/ats-mods/Stormwalker/releases/latest/
4. Extract into the same Against the Storm game directory.
5. Run the game

Note that I bundle a BepInEx config with my release, which changes the loader's entry point. That's all it does. If you know what you're doing you can make the required changes yourself and just use the .dll
